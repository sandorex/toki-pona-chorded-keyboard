# Experimental Chorded Keyboard For Toki Pona
This repository is meant as an experiment how fast one could type on a [chorded keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorded_keyboard) using [Toki Pona language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona) which has about 120 words

> **WARNING** the keyboard is very very early in development, it will be improved upon in the future when i have the time

# Keybindings
Currently the keyboard uses keys `asdfjkl;` which represent a binary number where `;` is the LSB, that number is then searched in [words.json](./words.json) and that string is used
